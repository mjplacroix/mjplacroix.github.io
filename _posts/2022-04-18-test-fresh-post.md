Increasing visibility to decrease risk. Applying Machine Learning to geographically assess global API manufacturing.

# Global API manufacturing capacity is concentrated in Indiaâ€‹ 

Heat map of API facilities approved by US, EU, Japan, Korea and NZ. Each unit either a product-facility-approval country combination or lower level of resolution (depending on granularity of the data). Hoverable details for each country like XXX US DMFs, YYY EU CEPs etc. 

Below are different angles the rest of this post could take. 


# India dominates in API registration filings to stringent regulatory authorities 


# Facilities in India tend to have broader capabilities whereas Chinese firms are more specialized


# US API registrations from European and the US manufacturers have declined over time


# Methodology

The Medicine Supply Map team applied Natural Language Processing (NLP) and geocoding algorithms to connect DMF holders to specific manufacturing facilities. The model accurately uncovers facility information for more than 80% of active, type II, API DMFs.

# Therapeutic class analysis

Over 80% of API antiviral manufacturing sites that support US markets are located in India and China. <br>

Analgesics have the highest portion of DMFs sourced in the US at 25%.



# Additional research ideas:

1. Studying therapeutic class implications
2. Evaluating the offshoring impact on drug shortage risk. Prior work has shown a negative correlation between shortage risk and geographic diversity (diversifying supply points enhances supply chain resilience).
3. Generic vs non-generics by location
4. Impact of competition
5. Number of products by facility
6. Proxy for outsourcing
